# Walkthrough - Multi-language Support (EN/ZH-TW)

I have implemented full English and Traditional Chinese support for the Resource ROI Calculator.

## Key Features
- **Language Switcher**: A floating button in the top-right corner allows switching between English and Traditional Chinese.
- **Localized UI**: All sidebars, charts, and metrics are fully translated.
- **Session Persistence**: Your language choice is maintained throughout the session.

## GitHub Commit History
The implementation is split into 10 logical commits (this is the 9th).
